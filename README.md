# CartPole v1 Reinforcement Learning Models

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that implement and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms for the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI's Gym. The notebooks cover:

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**

## Overview

The CartPole-v1 environment is a classic reinforcement learning problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart by applying forces to the left or right. This repository provides Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation and performance of two popular reinforcement learning algorithms:

1. **PPO**: An on-policy algorithm that learns a policy directly and optimizes it using a surrogate objective function.
2. **DQN**: An off-policy algorithm that learns a Q-function to estimate the value of taking an action in a given state.
